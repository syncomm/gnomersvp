Description: A text reader using Rapid Serial Visual Projection
 Rapid Serial Visual Projection is the process of blasting words onto
 the screen.  In this dynamic representation of text, each word is
 flashed on the screen one at a time in succession.  The reader is less
 inclined to "oralize" the text, rather the reader interprets whole
 words as meaningful written symbols.  Automatic re-reading of adjacent
 previous text is therefore rendered impossible. This results in much
 higher reading speeds than are possible with standard techniques.
