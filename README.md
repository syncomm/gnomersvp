## What is Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)?
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation is the process of blasting words onto the screen. In this dynamic representation of text, each word is flashed on the screen one at a time in succession. The reader is less inclined to “oralize” the text, rather the reader interprets whole words as meaningful written symbols. Automatic re-reading of adjacent previous text is therefore rendered impossible. This results in much higher reading speeds than are possible with conventional techniques.
