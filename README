Rapid Serial Visual Projection is the process of blasting words onto
the screen.  In this dynamic representation of text, each word is
flashed on the screen one at a time in succession.  The reader is less
inclined to "oralize" the text, rather the reader interprets whole
words as meaningful written symbols. Automatic re-reading of adjacent
previous text is therefore rendered impossible. This results in much
higher reading speeds than are possible with standard techniques.

If you think this might be cool to see run make install and choose
GnomeRSVP from the panel apps menu.
